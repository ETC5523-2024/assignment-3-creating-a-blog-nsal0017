## Introduction

Have you ever look at certain states in America and think to yourself, why do these states have more ghosts legends? This blog post looks at the haunted places across the United States and uses data to provide answers to those interested in paranormal activities. When considering over 11 thousand haunted places, we will determine which states are the most scary, and which kind of places are scarier most often. Apart from the purpose of the guide for paranormal tourists, this research can also provides the understanding about cultural and historical values.

## Problem Discription

Some of them are historical sites, battlefields, cemeteries or formerly conceived homes of notorious murderers that are all believed to be haunted. However, the question remains: Which states are actually more paranormal than others? What types of locations are said to be most frequently haunted? We posed two research questions: ‘What is the between historical event and haunting?’, and ‘What historical events are associated with haunted locations?’ Using a sample of almost 11,000 self-reported haunted locations from across the United States, we sought to answer these questions and explore the relationship between historical events and hauntings.

## Data Description

The data set was sourced from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-10-10/readme.md), has about 11,000 rows. Each row has details like where the spooky place is (city, state, and map points), a brief of the site, and type (e.g., inn, graveyard). The main bits for this study are:

- City: The town where it is found.
- State: The U.S. state of the spooky spot.
- Description: A short text box telling what the site is like.
- Coordinates: Long and lat points to put the places on a map.

The dataset provided by TidyTuesday was already cleaned to a large extent, minimizing the need for extensive data wrangling.

## Analysis

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: Top seven haunted locations

# Top 7 haunted location in the US
location_counts <- haunted_places %>%
  group_by(location, state) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(7)
# craeting table
location_counts |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```
@tbl-one


```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| label: fig-one
#| fig-cap: Top seven haunted locations graph

ggplot(location_counts, aes(x = state, y = count, fill = location)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +  
  labs(title = "Number of Haunted Places by State and Type",
       x = "State",
       y = "Number of Haunted Places",
       fill = "Location Type") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| label: fig-two
#| fig-cap: Top seven haunted states in the US
 
# Filter the top 7 states by the number of haunted places
state_data_top7 <- haunted_places %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  slice_max(Count, n = 7) 

# Create the ggplot 
p <- ggplot(state_data_top7, aes(x = reorder(state, -Count), y = Count, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkblue", size = 1) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "darkblue", fill = "lightblue", shape = 21) +  
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "Top 7 States by Number of Haunted Places",
       x = "State",
       y = "Number of Haunted Places") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

# Convert the ggplot object to a Plotly plot
ggplotly(p)
