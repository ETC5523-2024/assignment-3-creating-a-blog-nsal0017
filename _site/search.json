However, the question remains: Which states are actually more paranormal than others? What types of locations are said to be most frequently haunted? We posed two research questions: ‘What is the between historical event and haunting?’, and ‘What historical events are associated with haunted locations?’ Using a sample of almost 11,000 self-reported haunted locations from across the United States, we sought to answer these questions and explore the relationship between historical events and hauntings."
