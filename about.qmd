I am a dedicated student at Monash University, currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics, , building on a strong academic foundation with a Bachelor's in Commerce from DAVV, India. Along with my academic journey, I have experience working as a teacher, where I organized and managed a number of school events, which helped me develop strong leadership and project management skills. 

I am proficient in tools like Python, SQL, and GitHub, enabling me to transform raw data into actionable insights. I am passionate about applying these skills in the business world and aim to work in data consulting or business intelligence.
